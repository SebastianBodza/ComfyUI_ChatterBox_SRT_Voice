# ChatterboxTTS Dependencies for ComfyUI

# --- IMPORTANT: TROUBLESHOOTING INSTALLATION ---
# Some dependencies, particularly 's3tokenizer', can occasionally cause installation
# issues on certain Python setups (e.g., Python 3.10, sometimes used by tools like Stability Matrix).
# These issues often manifest as errors related to 'distutils', 'setuptools', or 'egg_info'
# during the build process of a package.
#
# To minimize potential problems, it's HIGHLY RECOMMENDED to first ensure your
# core packaging tools are up-to-date in your activated ComfyUI virtual environment:
#      python -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
#
# After running the command above, proceed to install these requirements:
#   pip install -r requirements.txt
#
# If you still encounter issues after these steps:
#   - Restart ComfyUI and let the ComfyUI Manager retry the installation.
#   - As a last resort, consider recreating your virtual environment, then running the
#     `pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel` command again before installing any custom node requirements.
